                Antoine Pour Elle ðŸŒ¸ðŸŒ¸ is a smell for women- an excellent fragrance-based composition that is enhanced by the feminine scents of pink.

At first, you only smell feminine perfumes, but it soon turns out that a man's aroma will not look far. Dominant scent notes: amber and petals. <br> Secondary scents: cedar, incense, rose, flint.

Antoine Pour Elle laundry detergents
- Concentrated product (3: 1);
- One cap (20 ml) is enough to wash 10 t-shirts or 3 kg clothes;
- Can be washed at 30 degrees; -
- If you want to avoid unwanted mixing of two different odors, we recommend using equally fragrant products (detergent + softener).
Capacity: 750 ml. About 30 washes will be enough.
